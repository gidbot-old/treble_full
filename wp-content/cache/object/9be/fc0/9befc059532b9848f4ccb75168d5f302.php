<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you sit down to review a project like R&amp;B/Pop singer Frank Ocean‚Äôs third studio album <i>Blonde</i> (or <i>Blond</i>, if you have the magazine version), your first instinct is to treat it like you would any other assignment. You ask questions like:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What was the artist aiming to achieve with this project?
</span><span class="s1">How did he/she do it?
</span><span class="s1">Was it clear, concise, effective?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You approach it in a vacuum. You try to be objective. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But that‚Äôs not how things really get made or consumed. Your perspective on anything is always under the influence of where you are, how you feel, who you‚Äôre with, etc. That‚Äôs why Ocean groomed as close to a perfect world as he could, visual accompaniment and all, to take with you as you float through the 17 tracks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Over 4 years after his acclaimed debut album <i><a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/">Channel Orange</a></i>, an inescapable cloud of hype and comically exaggerated frustration had shrouded Ocean. With expectations at an all-time high, it was shaping up to be a pivotal moment for the 28-year old singer who got his start ghostwriting pop songs and hanging out with his Odd Future collaborators. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> As more artists rush themselves to stay relevant and cash in on hype, Ocean slowed his tempo. He recorded 2 studio albums over the course of 4 years and waited to release them within days of each other. He traveled the world to curate a <a href="http://www.papermag.com/everything-we-know-about-boys-dont-cry-frank-ocean-zine-blonde-1981443713.html">300+ page magazine</a> that looks and feels like a coffee table art collection. He (reportedly) pushed back an already-delayed album release 2 more weeks after a New York Times article spoiled the surprise. He deviated from the alternating live-band/MPC-constructed drum patterns on his debut effort for a more ambient, focused sound. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The result of all this care? A project whose very existence serves as a victory for Ocean and other young artists who aspire to create something immersive and lasting; a 17-track, radio-unfriendly, magazine-accompanied, independently released ambient Pop album that is now set to debut at #1 on Billboard. Blond is proof that artists don‚Äôt have to play by ‚Äúbest industry practices‚Äù to get and keep people‚Äôs attention. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But beyond the context surrounding this enormous achievement, beyond the visuals accompaniments, French fry poems, and neon hairdos, the music itself is an intricately woven effort that plays out more like a movie score than an album. Though there are moments that test even a dedicated listener‚Äôs attention span, such as skits with his mother, brother and friends, Ocean makes up for them with his sheer talent and use of tension throughout.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> <i>Blonde </i>exudes a type of artistic confidence only possible in someone who has been in the game for a very long time. Shifting seamlessly between vocal registers and styles, Ocean glosses himself generously over every moment of this 61-minute project, unafraid to sing from the chest when necessary (i.e. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not brave!‚Äù in ‚ÄúSeigried‚Äù or the end of ‚ÄúIvy‚Äù). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Perhaps the most impressive thing about <i>Blonde</i> and Ocean as a songwriter is his ability to phrase simple ideas in compelling, memorable ways. What this album lacks in catchy hooks, it makes up for with homerun lines that act as the theses for their respective songs, such as ‚ÄúWe breathin‚Äô pheromones, Amber Rose// Sippin‚Äô pink-gold lemonades,‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI ain't making minimum wage momma// I'm on momma.‚Äù </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Ocean developed and released <i>Blonde </i>to be consumed as a single entity. He released it with a magazine packed with content just to ensure that you would sit down and take your time with it. Its success will hinge upon the context in which you hear it. This is a strange analogy, but think of it like an album full of strip-club hits. Just like that artist might be asking you to step out of your house and into the club, Ocean is asking you to step out of your world for 61 minutes and into an imaginary, atmospheric world of his curation with soft guitar licks, gospel-inspired chords and lots and lots of emotion. </span></p>";s:10:"post_title";s:38:"Enter Frank's Curated World on 'Blond'";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:17:"frank-ocean-blond";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2016-10-10 10:41:27";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2016-10-10 14:41:27";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:28:"http://blog.treble.fm/?p=301";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
